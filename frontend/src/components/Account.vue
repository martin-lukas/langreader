    <p>This is your account page. There is not much in here right now, but there will be a lot
    of statistics in the future, and it will all be very interesting. You'll see. There will be
    stuff like, how many words you know, which languages you're studying, now many texts you've
    added, or go through all the words you're currently studying</p>
